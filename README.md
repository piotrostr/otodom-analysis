# OTODOM analysis

scrape all of the properties in some polish city into a `pd.DataFrame` and
have some fun with it!

pages.pkl contains 7k properties from Gdansk; there is no git-lfs, file is like 58MB

I want to use some more Google Maps API based features, like the distance to
the center and the closest SKM stop etc to regress and potentially improve my
apartment search:)
